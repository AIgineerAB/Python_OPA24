# Conclusion

In the last week of this course, we will be:
- review the roadmap from AI1 and AI2, and overview contents for AI2
- conclude AI1 by creating a simple dashboard app with streamlit
- preview AI2 by looking at a more developed dashboard app, MYH dashboard app, with streamlit

In the first week of AI2, will be having a closer look at the coding of the MYH dashboard app, for instance:
- pathlib
- duckdb and expression
- modularize
- etc

You can follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=060WlhMJ5Ys) for the tutorial of building the MYH dashboard app.
